# Rain_Tutorial
TheChernoProject-Rain

master branch is the branch I plan on using to complete this tutorial, but I added
the Borken_SpriteSheet branch so that I can use trial and error to fix my sprite sheet issue.

Broken Sprite sheet issues
1. I see grid lines
2. I can not move the graphic around using arrow keys
